# Node AVR Multi-Bootloader

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jgillick/node-multibootloader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jgillick/node-multibootloader)

This tool and API can program many devices at once over a multidrop bus, like RS485.
It was written with AVR devices in mind, via the [AVR Multidrop Bootloader](https://github.com/jgillick/avr-multidrop-bootloader),
but it could be usable for other devices as well.
